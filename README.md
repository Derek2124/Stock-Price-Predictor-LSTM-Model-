# Stock-Price-Predictor-LSTM-Model-
 This Python script builds and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices using historical stock returns. It leverages deep learning techniques with key Python libraries: PyTorch for constructing the neural network, pandas for data handling, and Matplotlib for visualization
